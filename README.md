# Paper

The Prototype of a personal idea about sharing reading experiences of books.

I have started this project **to continue my learning journey in a practical way**.
I aim **to apply what I learn and improve my abilities**, by implementing new features and refactoring the old ones.
 
**Through this project, I also learned and developed [back-end of the project](https://github.com/alirezaa-latifi/paper-backend) with Express.**
